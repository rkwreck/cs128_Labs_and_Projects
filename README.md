# About

This repository is a back-up for all my work in UIUC's CS 128 Intro to CS II course. This READ.me contains basic descriptions of each lab & project. 

All code is written in C++.

##  MP = Coding projects (2-3 weeks) 
Specs include diagrams/figures of expected output.

### MP Musical Trees using Genetic Algorithm
Detailed spec: https://www.cs128live.org/course-book/mps/MusicalTrees

Summary: Generates musical melodies through a genetic algorithm and trees. Genetic algorithm includes selection, reproduction, and pruning phases. 

motif_node.cc has my own creative adjustment (using A minor duration pitch + penalization for repetition)

### MP Seam Carver
Detailed spec: https://www.cs128live.org/course-book/mps/SeamCarver

Summary: An algorithm that re-sizes an image by determining "seams" of an image that contain the least important pixels, and removing those seams. Adapted from the 2012 paper ["Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing"](https://perso.crans.org/frenoy/matlab2012/seamcarving.pdf). 

### MP Hangman (Evil Algorithm)
Detailed spec: https://www.cs128live.org/course-book/mps/WordGuess

Summary: A word-guessing game with a "neutral version" (Normal Hangman) and an "evil version." In the evil version, the algorithm does not pre-select a word. Instead, it continuoulsy filters through a dictionary with each guess that the user makes, maintaing as large of a subset of the dictionary as possible and not choosing a word until it is finally forced to.

## Labs (4-5 days) 
More labs to be posted soon. 

### Lab 11 : Templated Balanced Binary Tree 
Summary: Creates a binary tree and ensures that it is balanced with each node that is added. Checks if the tree is BST.
